# Benchtop Spin Stand

This project included the design, development, sourcing, fabrication and testing of all mechanical, electrical, and software components of a benchtop spin stand designed to evaluate automotive gasket retention performance when subjected to typical shipping load conditions and configurations. Presented here are pictures of the 3D-printed final assembly (mechanical) and Arduino code (software) that enables stand-alone operation with custom user input. Not included here is the full schematic (electrical).
