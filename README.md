# Benchtop Spin Stand

This project included the design, development, sourcing, fabrication and testing of all mechanical, electrical, and software components of a benchtop spin stand designed to evaluate automotive gasket retention performance when subjected to typical shipping load conditions and configurations. Presented here are pictures of the 3D-printed final assembly (mechanical) and Arduino code (software) that enables stand-alone operation with custom user input. Not included here is the full schematic (electrical). Therefore, as a brief summary, the spin stand includes 24V, 12V and 5V circuits; internal LEDs; multiple potentiometers to facilitate user input; dual 20x4 LCD screens with I2C serial interface adapters; front and rear fan circuits; and multiple switches for real-time customization of the testing equipment.
